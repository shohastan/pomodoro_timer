# Pomodoro TimerBoost Productivity with the Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that helps you stay focused, maintain productivity, and avoid burnout.

## Work Intervals
Break your work into short, focused intervals. These intervals are called ‚ÄúPomodoros.‚Äù During a Pomodoro, you concentrate solely on the task at hand.
## Set a Timer
Use a timer to track your Pomodoro. When the timer starts, immerse yourself in work without distractions. No checking emails, social media, or other unrelated tasks.
## Take Short Breaks
After completing a Pomodoro, take a short break. Step away from your work, stretch, or grab a quick snack. These breaks help recharge your mind.
## Repeat and Rest
After four Pomodoros, take a longer break. Use this time to relax, reflect, or do something enjoyable. Then start another cycle.


# Why it works
## Focus
By breaking work into smaller chunks, you maintain better focus. It‚Äôs easier to stay productive for 25 minutes than for hours on end.
## Avoid Burnout
Regular breaks prevent mental fatigue. They also reduce the risk of burnout, as you‚Äôre not pushing yourself too hard continuously.
## Time Awareness
The timer keeps you accountable. Knowing you have only 25 minutes encourages efficient work.
## Task Completion
Completing Pomodoros gives a sense of accomplishment. You‚Äôll see progress and feel motivated.
